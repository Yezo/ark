<!-- PROJECT INFORMATION -->
## Introduction

This project was designed and developed by myself as a work sample for riskthinking.ai. Following their guidelines, the objective was to create a compelling visualization of climate risk datasets using various formats such as charts, maps, and tables. Furthermore, the project required an integrated user interface that seamlessly incorporated multiple components and offered interactive functionality for users to engage with.

In order to meet these requirements, I carefully crafted an interface that effectively showcased the climate risk datasets through visually appealing and informative charts, maps, and tables. The goal was to present the data in a manner that facilitated easy comprehension and allowed users to explore different insights. By integrating various components, I ensured a cohesive user experience, enabling users to navigate seamlessly between different views and access the information they needed.

## Features
- Utilizes PapaParse to parse CSV data into a JSON object
- Features reusable custom hooks for parsing data objects
- Map with markers for each Business
- Charts with dynamic data for Risk Ratings
- Data table with sorting and filtering functionality
- Implemented user interactivity shared amongst components
- Optimized for dynamic importing of components
- Optimized data table with pagination
- Optimized SEO by defining metatags for different pages
